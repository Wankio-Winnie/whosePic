WhosePic
Add photos, label faces once, and find every picture a person appears in — entirely in your browser.
WhosePic is a fully client-side face-recognition photo album. There is no backend, no database, and no account. Face detection and recognition run in-browser via @vladmandic/face-api, and your photos never leave your device.
How it works
    • Detection + recognition run in the browser. A photo is decoded to a canvas, faces are detected, and each face gets a 128-d descriptor.
    • State lives in a Zustand store. It is persisted to IndexedDB so a page refresh keeps your session.
    • Lifecycle — a per-tab sessionStorage marker means that opening the site fresh (after the tab was closed) wipes any leftover IndexedDB data before the app starts. So a refresh keeps your work; closing the site discards it.
    • Matching — "tag once, find everywhere" is euclidean-distance search over the 128-d descriptors, done client-side (replacing what used to be a pgvector query).
Nothing is uploaded. Nothing is stored on a server.
Stack
    • Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) + Tailwind
    • @vladmandic/face-api (TensorFlow.js) for in-browser detection + recognition
    • Zustand + idb-keyval for state and IndexedDB persistence
Layout
    • frontend/ — the entire app
        ◦ src/lib/faceEngine.ts — face-api wrapper (the only module that touches it)
        ◦ src/lib/sessionStore.ts — Zustand store + IndexedDB persistence + boot logic
        ◦ src/lib/selectors.ts — client-side matching / derived data
        ◦ src/components/SessionGate.tsx — runs boot, gates the app until hydrated
        ◦ public/models/ — face-api model weights (committed; ~12 MB)
Run
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000.
The face-api model weights in frontend/public/models/ are committed to the repo, so there is nothing else to download or configure.
Smoke test
    1. Go to /upload and add a clear multi-face photo — faces are detected and you land on /image/{id} with bounding boxes.
    2. Click a box and label the face (type a new name to create it).
    3. Add another photo of the same person — select that face; a "Suggestion" strip proposes the existing label. Click to confirm.
    4. /people lists labelled people; /people/{id} has "Labelled" and "Suggested" tabs.
    5. Refresh the page — everything is still there (rehydrated from IndexedDB).
    6. Close the tab and reopen the site — the session is gone.
Notes
    • Capacity — IndexedDB is large, but if a write hits the quota a banner appears and the app keeps running in-memory for the rest of the session.
    • Accuracy — the in-browser 128-d recognizer is lighter than a server-side ArcFace model; suggestions are best on clear, front-facing photos and are always confirmed by one click rather than applied automatically.
